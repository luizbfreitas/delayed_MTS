# delayed_mts

A software to set matching to sample trials with different options of delay

I used Tkinter to build this software.

To use it you will need a folder with images (300 x 162 pixels) you will show in matching to sample trials. You can set the trials in a csv file. The sofware will run all the trials in the file in sequence.

A log file marking the position os the chosen comparisson and if it was a right or wrong response is generated in the end of session.
An observation response is required in the sample image to go foward and show the comparissons. User can respond either with the mouse or in a touch screen.
