# delayed_mts

A software to set matching to sample trials with different options of delay

I used Tkinter to build this software.

The application uses folders with pictures as reference to set the trials. User will choose the categories used in trials. After that the application will generate a .csv file with randomized trials to be used in runtime. User can either chose the time delay (0, 2, 5, 10, 20) between observation response and onset of comparisson stimuli.

A log file register the position of chosen comparisson stimulus, if it was a correct or incorrect response and totals of correct and incorrect responses.

An observation response is required in the sample image to go forward and show the comparissons. User can respond either with the mouse or in a touch screen.
